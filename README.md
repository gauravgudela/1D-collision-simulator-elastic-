uh so there are basically two masses and they collide but but but you yes YOU can give them their masses and velocities (how cool is that(maybenot)) 

and they collide and they exchange energy because they obey law of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy like goodboys 

also they collide with walls but dont exchange energy with the walls they just change the direction

um thats basically it(also i made it in like 2 hrs or sum)
